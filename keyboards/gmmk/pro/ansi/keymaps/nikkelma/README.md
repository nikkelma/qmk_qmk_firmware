# `nikkelma` GMMK PRO ANSI keymap

This layout inherits many of the features/design of the default keymap:
- FN is a momentary toggle to layer 1
- FN + backslash maps to the RESET key
- Fn + N toggles NKRO

A few swaps have been made on the base layer to accommodate for my
preferences as a software engineer to have home and end alongside of delete.

Delete is between F12 and the encoder knob, while the right system
key column from top to bottom is Home / End / PgUp / PgDn.

I swapped to this keyboard from a WASD Code keyboard, so I've gained muscle
memory of using my thumb on FN and right fingers to control media playback:
- Fn + Home -> Play
- Fn + End  -> Next
- Fn + PgUp -> Prev
